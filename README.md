CodeFirstGirls Group Project at Twitter using Edamam Recipe API and Python

Our program can inspire you with a great recipe from the ingredients in your fridge. If you are on a diet, it's not a problem. We will ask what kind of food are you on and then based on your answer, we will provide you with delicious recipes (through EDAMAM API). Sounds good? On top of that, we will tell you how many calories and health restrictions/allergens there are in each recipe. Also, all results will be kept saved in a file for your future reference.
